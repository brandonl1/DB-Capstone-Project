**Applied Learning Project Summary**

Throughout this applied learning project, you will develop and demonstrate your expertise in database management, automation, and data modeling through a series of practical, real-world tasks.

**Database Normalization and Relational Schema Design:** You will begin by structuring your own relational database. This involves defining relationships between entities and developing a comprehensive relational schema, showcasing your understanding of database normalization principles.

**Stored Procedure Development:** Next, you will focus on SQL automation by writing a stored procedure to solve real-world problems. This project will highlight your ability to automate database tasks, improving efficiency and consistency in database operations.

**Python-Administered MySQL Database:** You will then apply your Python programming skills to create an application that administers a MySQL database. This task will involve programming the database's interactions with clients, demonstrating your ability to integrate Python with database management.

**Advanced Data Modeling Application:** In this project, you will apply advanced data modeling concepts to a real-world scenario. You'll focus on automation, storage, and optimization, ensuring the database is efficient, scalable, and optimized for performance.

**MySQL Database Solution for an App:** Finally, you will synthesize the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program to design and implement a complete MySQL database solution for an application. This capstone project will demonstrate your comprehensive understanding of database architecture, from initial design to final implementation.
